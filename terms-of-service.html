<p>This is a contract between you (the Customer) and us (DoInbound). It describes the services we will provide to you, how we will work together, and other aspects of our business relationship. It is a legal document so some of the language is necessarily “legalese,” but we have tried to make it as readable as possible. These terms are so important though that we cannot provide these services unless you agree to them. By using the Subscription Service, you are agreeing to these terms.</p>
<p>We periodically update these terms and we will let you know when we do by email.</p>
<p>1. Definitions</p>
<p>"Agreement" means these Customer Terms of Service and all materials referred or linked to in here.</p>
<p>"Billing Period" means the period for which you agree to prepay fees under an Order Form, which will be the same as or shorter than the Subscription Term. For example, if you subscribe to the Subscription Service for a one (1) year Initial Subscription Term, with a twelve (12) month upfront payment, the Billing Period will be twelve (12) months.</p>
<p>"Communication Services" means third-party forums, online communities, blogs, personal web pages, calendars, and/or other social media communication facilities (such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn) linked to or from the Subscription Service that enable you to communicate with the public or with a private group.</p>
<p>"Contact" means a single customer, prospect, lead, or other individual (other than a User) whose Contact Information is stored by you in the Subscription Service.</p>
<p>"Contact Information" means the name, email address, phone number, online user name(s), telephone number, and similar information submitted by visitors to your landing pages on the Subscription Service or uploaded by you to the Subscription Service.</p>
<p>"Consulting Services" means the professional services provided to you by us, which may include training services, installation, integration or other consulting services.</p>
<p>"Customer Data" means all information that you submit or collect via the Subscription Service.</p>
<p>"Customer Materials" means all materials that you provide or post, upload, input or submit for public display through the Subscription Service.</p>
<p>"DoInbound Content" means all information, data, text, messages, software, sound, music, video, photographs, graphics, images, and tags that we incorporate into the Subscription Service or Consulting Services.</p>
<p>"Order Form" or "Order" means the DoInbound-approved form by which you agree to subscribe to the Subscription Service and purchase Consulting Services. Most Orders are completed through our online payment process. The purchase form may be referred to as a "Statement of Work" if you are purchasing only Consulting Services.</p>
<p>"Sensitive Information" means credit or debit card numbers; personal financial account information; Social Security numbers; passport numbers; driver’s license numbers or similar identifiers; racial or ethnic origin; physical or mental health condition or information; or other employment, financial or health information, including any information subject to regulations, laws or industry standards designed to protect data privacy and security, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards.</p>
<p>"Subscription Service" means our web-based inbound marketing campaign management tools and platform that you have subscribed to by an Order Form, and developed, operated, and maintained by us, accessible via <a href="http://www.doinbound.com/" target="_blank">doinbound.com</a> or another designated URL, and any ancillary products and services, including website hosting, that we provide to you.</p>
<p>"Subscription Term" means the Initial Subscription Term and all Renewal Subscription Terms.</p>
<p>"Third-Party Products" means non-embedded products and professional services that are provided by third parties which interoperate with or are used in connection with the Subscription Service.</p>
<p>"Third-Party Sites" means third-party websites linked from within the Subscription Service, including Communications Services.</p>
<p>"Users" means your employees, representatives, consultants, contractors or agents who are authorized to use the Subscription Service for your benefit and have unique user identifications and passwords for the Subscription Service.</p>
<p>"We","us" or “our” means DoInbound,LLC.</p>
<p>"You" or “Customer” means the person or entity using the Subscription Service or receiving the Consulting Services and identified in the applicable billing statement, Order Form or Statement of Work as the customer.</p>
<p>2. The Subscription Service</p>
<p>a. Access. During the Subscription Term , we will provide you access to use the Subscription Service as described in this Agreement.</p>
<p>b. Limits. Limits may apply to the number of Clients. Any limits will be specified in your Order Form and this Agreement.</p>
<p>c. Modifications. We modify the Subscription Service from time to time, including by adding or deleting features and functions, in an effort to improve your experience. But we will not make changes to the Subscription Service that materially reduce the functionality of the Subscription Service provided to you during the Subscription Term. We might provide some or all elements of the Subscription Service through third party service providers.</p>
<p>d. Additional Features. You may subscribe to additional features of the Subscription Service by agreeing to a new Order Form.</p>
<p>e. Free Trial. If We offer and you register for a free trial of the Subscription Service, we will make the Subscription Service available to you on a trial basis free of charge until the earlier of (a) the end of the free trial period or (b) the start date of your subscription. If we include additional terms and conditions on the trial registration web page, those will apply as well. During the free trial period, (i) the Subscription Service is provided “as is” and without warranty of any kind, (ii) we may suspend, limit, or terminate the Subscription Service for any reason at any time without notice, and (iii) we will not be liable to you for damages of any kind related to your use of the Subscription Service.

<p>3. Customer Support</p>
<p>a. Support. Support is included in your Subscription Fee. We accept webform support questions 24 Hours per Day x 7 Days per Week at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.doinbound.com/contact">doinbound.com/contact</a>.

<p>4. Consulting Services</p>
<p>We may provide Consulting Services to you pursuant to an Order Form or Statement of Work. Fees for these Consulting Services are in addition to your Subscription Fee. Unless otherwise agreed, all Consulting Services are performed remotely.</p>
<p>For Consulting Services performed on-site, you will reimburse us our reasonable cost for all expenses incurred in connection with the Consulting Services. Any invoices or other requests for reimbursements will be due and payable within twenty one (21) days of receipt of the invoice.</p>
<p>Hours purchased as part of a consulting package are non-refundable and expire as set forth in the Order Form, but in any case no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days from purchase.</p>
<p>5. Fees and Payments</p>
<p>a. Subscription Fees. The Subscription Fee will remain fixed during the Subscription Term unless you (i) change products or base packages, or (ii) subscribe to additional features or products, including additional Clients. Where a price change applies to you, we will charge or invoice you under the new price structure, starting with the next Billing Period in the Subscription Term, except as provided below under “Fee Adjustments During a Billing Period”. In order to avoid additional charges, you should purchase the appropriate tier of Subscription Service for your anticipated needs. We will monitor or audit remotely the number of Clients in the Subscription Service.</p>
<p>b. Fee Adjustments in Current and Next Billing Period. If you add an additional Client in a Billing Period, then your Subscription Fee will be prorated from that date to the end of the current billing period. It will be adjusted at the beginning of the next Billing Period up to the current base package and tier price which corresponds with the maximum number of Clients from the prior Billing Period. This process will continue for each Billing Period during the Subscription Term. Our pricing and limits will be as set forth at <a href="https://www.doinbound.com/" target="_blank">doinbound.com</a>. We determine the number of Clients. At your request, we will provide you with the detail we used to we reach our conclusion. Once increased, your Subscription Fee can be decreased if there is a subsequent reduction in the number of Clients.</p>
<p>c. Payment by credit card. If you are paying by credit card, you authorize us to charge your credit card or bank account for all fees payable at the beginning of the Initial Subscription Term and all subsequent Billing Periods, including upgrades. You further authorize us to use a third party to process payments, and consent to the disclosure of your payment information to such third party.</p>
<p>d. Payment against invoice. If you are paying by invoice, we will invoice you at the beginning of the Initial Subscription Term and at the beginning of each subsequent Billing Period. All amounts invoiced are due and payable within twenty-one (21) days from the date of the invoice, unless otherwise specified in the Order Form.</p>
<p>e. Payment Information. You will keep your contact information, billing information and credit card information (where applicable) up to date. All payment obligations are non-cancelable and all amounts paid are non-refundable, except as specifically provided for in this Agreement. All fees are due and payable in advance throughout the Subscription Term.</p>
<p>f. Sales Tax. All fees are exclusive of taxes, which we will charge as applicable. You agree to pay any taxes applicable to your use of the Subscription Service and performance of Consulting Services. You shall have no liability for any taxes based upon our gross revenues or net income.</p>
<p>6. Subscription Term and Renewal</p>
<p>a. Initial Subscription Term. The initial subscription term shall begin on the effective date of your Subscription and expire at the end of the period selected during the subscription process ("Initial Subscription Term").</p>
<p>b. Renewal Subscription Term. Unless one of us gives the other written notice that it does not intend to renew the subscription, this Agreement will automatically renew for the shorter of the Initial Subscription Term or one month ("Renewal Subscription Term"). The Renewal Subscription Term will be on the current terms and conditions of this Agreement, and subject to the renewal pricing provided for in your Order Form or, if not specified in the Order Form, on our standard pricing available at <a href="https://www.doinbound.com/" target="_blank">doinbound.com</a>.
